#learning_entities_nn_ga

This is a project, there is simple entities, their goal is to collect the most foor as possible.

**Entities :**
They are simple circles. They point in a direction, they got a field of view. The FOV is symbolized by 2 lines : red if it sees nothing, green else.
They are controlled all by their own neural network. There is one entrie : from the fov, and 2 outputs : to go forward and to rotate.

**Food :** 
They are little points and they are worth 1 point for the entities.

**Genetic algorithm :**
The neural networks of the entities evolve thanks to a genetic algorithm.
